# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my personal implementations and practice work on 'Data Structures and Algorithms' using **C and C++**.

## What’s Inside

### 1. Data Structures (From Scratch)
All core data structures are implemented manually without using STL or built-in libraries.

- Arrays  
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- Stacks  
- Queues  
- Trees (BST, Binary Tree)  
- Heaps  
- Hash Tables  
- Graphs  
- Tries  

Each structure includes common operations such as:
- Insertion  
- Deletion  
- Searching  
- Traversals  
- Updates  

### 2. LeetCode Practice
I solve LeetCode problems related to specific data structures to strengthen concepts.

- Problems grouped by data structure  
- Optimised and well-commented solutions  
- Time & space complexity mentioned where relevant  

## 🛠 Languages Used
- C  
- C++  
- JS (rare)
